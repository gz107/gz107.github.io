## About me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Power Engineering and Engineering Thermophysics at
Xi'an Jiaotong University.

My research focuses on adsorption thermodynamics, gas separation, and data-driven molecular simulation of porous materials.
I work at the interface of molecular modeling, machine learning, and energy systems, seeking to establish predictive structure–property relationships for adsorption-based technologies.

## Research Overview

My research aims to elucidate how pore geometry, surface chemistry, and thermodynamic conditions jointly determine the adsorption behavior of gases in nanoporous materials. I integrate:

Molecular simulation for microscopic adsorption mechanisms

Machine learning for surrogate modeling and material screening

Thermodynamic modeling for isotherm representation and prediction

Transport modeling for process-level performance evaluation

Ultimately, I focus on creating generalizable frameworks for adsorption-based hydrogen storage, carbon capture, and gas purification.
